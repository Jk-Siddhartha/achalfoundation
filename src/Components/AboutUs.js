              <p>
                I spent my 17th birthday in an orphanage, and after seeing the
                children there, their love, and their smiles, I realised that
                there was a lot that could be done for them and other children.
                That is when I founded the NGO; initially, I worked by myself,
                and then gradually, others joined. However, these new members
                only stayed for a few days or months; this is still the case
                today. The thing that kept me going was my unwavering
                determination to help people and improve society. â€” Soumay Singh
                Rawat
